You'll need modern TeX distribution (TeX Live 2008 is ok) with
METAPOST, GNU Guile, GNU Emacs (with recent CEDET version), GNU Make,
bash, m4, sed, patched texdepend to «build» this paper.

texdepend patch which allows using of several additional characters in
`\input` commands is available from the author of this paper.

As of December 2008, `grok-lisp.el` is desperately BROKEN, resulting
in empty gaps instead of Scheme sources in paper.

See http://sphinx.net.ru/blog/entry/latex-autobuild/ to find out about
techniques used to generate this paper.

This short paper was originally written in 2007 and is now preserved
for «historical» purposes
